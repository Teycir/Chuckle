# Auto-Cleanup Feature

## Overview

Chuckle now includes automatic storage management to maintain optimal performance and prevent storage quota issues. The cleanup system silently removes old memes when needed, ensuring the extension runs smoothly even after creating hundreds of memes.

## How It Works

### Two-Tier Cleanup Strategy

**1. Age-Based Cleanup (90 days)**
- Automatically removes memes older than 90 days
- Runs weekly in the background
- Prevents indefinite storage growth

**2. Quota-Based Cleanup (80% threshold)**
- Triggers when storage usage exceeds 80% (8MB of 10MB limit)
- Removes oldest memes first until storage drops to 60%
- Runs automatically before creating new memes
- Ensures you never hit the storage quota

### When Cleanup Happens

1. **Weekly Schedule**: Background cleanup runs every 7 days
2. **Pre-Generation**: Checks storage before creating each new meme
3. **Silent Operation**: No user interruption or notifications

## Technical Details

### Storage Limits
- Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` has a 10MB limit
- Each meme stores ~50-200KB (image data URL, text, metadata)
- After 100-200 memes, storage can become constrained

### Cleanup Algorithm

```typescript
// Age-based: Remove memes older than 90 days
const maxAge = 90 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 90 days in ms
if (now - meme.timestamp > maxAge) {
  remove(meme);
}

// Quota-based: Remove oldest when storage > 80%
if (storageUsage > 8MB) {
  removeOldestUntil(storageUsage < 6MB);
}
```

### What Gets Removed
- Memes older than 90 days
- Oldest memes when storage is full
- Non-favorited memes first (future enhancement)

### What's Preserved
- Recent memes (< 90 days)
- All memes when storage is below 80%
- User settings and preferences

## Performance Impact

### Before Auto-Cleanup
- Storage fills up after ~150-200 memes
- History panel becomes slow with 500+ memes
- Risk of hitting quota and losing ability to create memes
- Manual cleanup required

### After Auto-Cleanup
- Automatic maintenance keeps storage optimal
- Consistent performance regardless of usage
- No user intervention needed
- Prevents storage quota errors

## API Reference

### `performCleanup()`
Executes cleanup based on age and quota thresholds.

**Returns:**
```typescript
{
  removed: number;      // Number of memes removed
  freedBytes: number;   // Storage space freed
}
```

**Example:**
```typescript
const result = await performCleanup();
console.log(`Removed ${result.removed} memes, freed ${result.freedBytes} bytes`);
```

### `shouldCleanup()`
Checks if cleanup is needed based on storage usage.

**Returns:** `boolean` - true if storage exceeds 80%

**Example:**
```typescript
if (await shouldCleanup()) {
  await performCleanup();
}
```

## Configuration

### Constants (in `src/cleanup.ts`)
```typescript
const MAX_AGE_DAYS = 90;              // Age threshold
const STORAGE_THRESHOLD = 0.8;        // 80% quota trigger
const QUOTA_BYTES = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB limit
```

### Alarm Schedule (in `src/background.ts`)
```typescript
chrome.alarms.create('weeklyCleanup', { 
  periodInMinutes: 10080  // 7 days
});
```

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- [ ] Preserve favorited memes always
- [ ] User-configurable age threshold
- [ ] Cleanup notifications
- [ ] Manual cleanup button in Stats tab
- [ ] Storage usage indicator

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
- [ ] Migrate to IndexedDB for unlimited storage
- [ ] Selective cleanup by tags
- [ ] Archive mode (compress old memes)
- [ ] Undo support (7-day recovery)
- [ ] Cloud backup option

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Age-based cleanup (90 days)
- ✅ Quota-based cleanup (80% threshold)
- ✅ No cleanup when not needed
- ✅ Storage monitoring
- ✅ Integration with meme generation

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test -- cleanup.test.ts
```

## Monitoring

### Check Storage Usage
```javascript
// In browser console
chrome.storage.local.getBytesInUse((bytes) => {
  console.log(`Storage: ${(bytes / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(2)}MB / 10MB`);
});
```

### View Cleanup Logs
```javascript
// Background service worker console
// Look for: "[Chuckle] Cleaned X old memes, freed YKB"
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Will I lose my favorite memes?**
A: Currently, cleanup removes all old memes. Phase 2 will preserve favorites.

**Q: Can I disable auto-cleanup?**
A: Not yet. This will be configurable in Phase 2.

**Q: How do I know if cleanup ran?**
A: Check the background service worker console for cleanup logs.

**Q: What if I want to keep memes longer than 90 days?**
A: Phase 2 will add configurable age thresholds and favorite preservation.

## Migration Notes

### From Previous Versions
- No migration needed
- Cleanup runs automatically after update
- Existing memes are evaluated on first run

### Permissions Added
- `alarms` - Required for weekly scheduled cleanup

## Performance Metrics

### Cleanup Speed
- ~100ms for 100 memes
- ~500ms for 500 memes
- Runs in background, no UI blocking

### Storage Savings
- Average: 50-150KB per meme removed
- Typical cleanup: 20-50 memes = 1-7MB freed

## Best Practices

1. **Let it run automatically** - No manual intervention needed
2. **Export important memes** - Use Stats → Export Data for backups
3. **Monitor storage** - Check Stats tab for usage (future feature)
4. **Report issues** - If cleanup is too aggressive or not working
