# 📴 Offline Mode - Quick Guide

## What is Offline Mode?

Offline Mode lets you create memes **without using AI**. Your text is simply split in half - no fancy AI formatting, no template selection, just quick and simple meme generation.

## When Should You Use It?

✅ **Use Offline Mode when:**
- You want to save your daily API quota (1,500 free requests)
- You need super fast meme generation
- You prefer to manually choose templates yourself
- You want maximum privacy (fewer external requests)

❌ **Don't use Offline Mode when:**
- You want AI to pick the perfect template for your text
- You want AI to format your text for maximum humor
- You're okay with 2-3 second generation time

## How to Enable

1. Click the Chuckle icon in Chrome
2. Check the "📴 Offline Mode" box
3. Click "💾 Save Settings"
4. Done! Now all memes will be generated offline

## What Changes in Offline Mode?

### Before (AI Mode):
```
Your text: "When you finally understand recursion after the tenth explanation"

AI thinks... 🤔
→ Picks "Success Kid" template (perfect for victories!)
→ Formats: "Finally understand recursion / After tenth explanation"
→ Takes 2-3 seconds
```

### After (Offline Mode):
```
Your text: "When you finally understand recursion after the tenth explanation"

Simple split... ⚡
→ Uses "Drake" template (default)
→ Formats: "When you finally understand / recursion after the tenth explanation"
→ Takes <1 second
```

## What Still Works?

Everything else works exactly the same:

✅ **Template Selection** - Click any template to regenerate
✅ **Text Editing** - Click text to edit it
✅ **Download** - Save your meme as PNG
✅ **Share** - Share to Twitter, LinkedIn, Email
✅ **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Alt+M still works
✅ **Dark Mode** - All themes work
✅ **Multi-language** - All languages supported

## Example Workflow

1. **Enable Offline Mode** (one time setup)
2. **Highlight text** on any webpage (6-30 words)
3. **Press Alt+M** (or right-click → "Remix as a Meme")
4. **Meme appears instantly** with Drake template
5. **Click a different template** if you want (Woman Yelling at Cat, Distracted Boyfriend, etc.)
6. **Edit text** if needed (click on text)
7. **Download or share** your meme

## Tips

💡 **Pro Tip 1**: Offline mode is perfect for creating multiple meme variants quickly. Generate → Change template → Generate → Change template...

💡 **Pro Tip 3**: Your text is still validated (6-30 words) and sanitized for safety.
